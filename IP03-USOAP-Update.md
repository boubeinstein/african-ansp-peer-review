USOAP UPDATE

(Presented by the Secretariat)

SUMMARY

This paper presents an update of the 2024 edition of the Universal Safety Oversight Audit
Program (USOAP) Protocol Questions (PQs).

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.1
States’ safety oversight capability can be determined by accessing the implementation of
Protocol Questions (PQs). In the 2024 edition of the PQs a new category has been added and organized
by nine audit areas, each associated with one of the eight CEs. The eight audit areas are Primary aviation
legislation  and  specific  operating  regulations  (LEG);  Civil  aviation  organization  (ORG);  Personnel
licensing  and  training  (PEL);  Aircraft  operations  (OPS);  Airworthiness  of  aircraft  (AIR);  Aircraft
accident and incident investigation (AIG); Air navigation services (ANS); Aerodromes and ground aids
(AGA) and State Safety Program (SSP).

1.2
For a PQ to be assessed as “satisfactory”, States are required to show that all the elements
of the PQ have been implemented and provided all the relevant evidence, in order for a PQ to be fully
addressed. If a State provides insufficient or no evidence of compliance with the elements outlined in
the  PQ,  the  PQ  is  assessed  as  “not  satisfactory”.  The  State  is  required  to  develop  and  implement  a
corrective  action  plan (CAP)  that addresses  all  elements  of  the  “not satisfactory”  PQ,  including the
presentation of the necessary supporting documentation and evidence.

DISCUSSION

USOAP CMA Protocol Questions (PQs)

2.1
PQs  are  the  primary  tool  used  in  the  ICAO  USOAP  CMA  for  assessing  the  effective
implementation (EI) of the eight critical elements (CEs) of a State’s safety oversight system. Developed
based  on  ICAO  Standards  and  Recommended  Practices  (SARPs),  Procedures  for  Air  Navigation
Services (PANS) and ICAO guidance material, the PQs are revised periodically by ICAO to reflect
amendments to the ICAO provisions and reference documents.

2.2
The  USOAP  CMA  amended  the  PQs  in  2024  in  accordance  with  the  High-level
Conference  on  COVID-19  (HLCC  2021)  Recommendations  (C-WP/15312  refers)  regarding  the
integration of State Safety Program Implementation Assessment (SSPIA) with USOAP CMA activities,
that were approved by the Council of ICAO on 4 March 2022 (C-DEC 225/7 refers). A comparison of
the PQs in the 2020 and 2024 versions and number of changes for the ANS area are shown in Table 1.

Explanatory Note on the 2024 Edition of the Protocol Questions (PQs):

Revised on the basis of the 2020 edition, this 2024 edition of the USOAP CMA Protocol Questions (PQs) follows the High-level Conference on COVID-
19 (HLCC 2021) Recommendations (C-WP/15312 refers) regarding the integration of State Safety Programme Implementation Assessment (SSPIA) with
traditional  Universal  Safety  Oversight  Audit  Programme  (USOAP)  Continuous  Monitoring  Approach  (CMA)  activities  that  were  approved  by  the
Council of ICAO on 4 March 2022 (C-DEC 225/7 refers). Some notable features of this 2024 edition of PQs are the addition of Safety Management
System  (SMS)  related  PQs  to  the  areas  of  personnel  licensing  and  training  (PEL),  aircraft  operations  (OPS),  airworthiness  of  aircraft  (AIR),  air
navigation services (ANS), and aerodromes and ground aids (AGA), as well as the addition of a set of new PQs on State Safety  Programme (SSP) as a
new audit area.

The newly added PQs on SSP and SMS will have an undetermined status thus will not affect the Effective Implementation (EI)  scores, until they are
audited. Dedicated EI score for SSP will be provided separately. Once States and relevant regional organizations are migrated to the 2024 PQ edition, the
EI scores for the USOAP activities on safety oversight, as indicated on the USOAP CMA online framework, will be updated and adjusted accordingly.

The  existing  SSPIA  PQs,  including  the  self-assessments  submitted  and  the  assessment  results  for  those  States  which  had  received  SSPIAs,  will  be
archived and can be made available upon request.

Introduction to the ICAO USOAP CMA Protocol Questions

Protocol  Questions  (PQs)  are  the  primary  tool  used  in  the  ICAO  Universal  Safety  Oversight  Audit  Programme  (USOAP)  Continuous  Monitoring
Approach (CMA) for assessing the effective implementation of the eight critical elements (CEs) of a State’s safety oversight system. Developed based on
ICAO  Standards  and  Recommended  Practices  (SARPs),  Procedures  for  Air  Navigation  Services  (PANS)  and  ICAO  guidance  material,  the  PQs  are
revised periodically by ICAO to reflect amendments to the ICAO provisions and reference documents.

The PQs are organized by audit areas and each PQ is associated with one of the eight CEs.

The nine audit areas are as follows:

The eight CEs are as follows:

1)  Primary  aviation  legislation  and  specific  operating  regulations

(LEG);

2)  Civil aviation organization (ORG);
3)  Personnel licensing and training (PEL);
4)  Aircraft operations (OPS);
5)  Airworthiness of aircraft (AIR);
6)  Aircraft accident and incident investigation (AIG);
7)  Air navigation services (ANS);
8)  Aerodromes and ground aids (AGA); and
9)  State Safety Programme (SSP).

States are expected to use the PQs to conduct regular self-assessments and in this way, monitor the health of their aviation safety oversight system in a
proactive manner.

A State is deemed to have fully addressed a PQ when it has implemented all the required elements of the PQ. This generates a “satisfactory” status of
implementation for the PQ. If the State provides insufficient or no evidence of compliance with the elements outlined in the  PQ, the PQ is assessed as
“not  satisfactory”.  The  State  is  required  to  develop  and  implement  a  corrective  action  plan  (CAP)  which  fully  addresses  the  associated  PQ  and  all
identified deficiencies.

The status of each PQ for a State is reflected in the USOAP CMA Online Framework (https://www.icao.int/usoap) and summarized in the activity report.

For reference purposes, the PQs are hereby presented in a table format. Each PQ is assigned a PQ number (e.g. 1.001), associated with a CE (e.g. CE-1),
and supplemented by the relevant “Guidance for Review of Evidence” and “ICAO References”. PQs shown in shaded rows can be assessed only in a
USOAP CMA on-site activity, while Priority PQs are indicated as such (with “Yes” note) under the “PPQ” column.

For each PQ, the corresponding “Guidance for Review of Evidence” provides  an itemized list of elements to be implemented by the State in order to
address the PQ satisfactorily. When preparing for a USOAP CMA audit, States should use these listed elements, as applicable, to prepare the necessary
supporting documentation and evidence for all PQs within the scope of the audit. When preparing for an ICAO validation activity, States should provide
the  necessary  supporting  documentation  and  evidence  for  all  PQs,  within  the  scope  of  the  validation  activity,  that  were  previously  assessed  as  “not
satisfactory”.

Representatives of a State’s civil aviation authority/investigation authority who participate in USOAP CMA activities should  be familiar with each PQ
and the related “Guidance for Review of Evidence” that will be addressed during the activities. All the information and evidence for each PQ that are to
be provided to the USOAP CMA activity team should be prepared in advance.

The “Summary of Amendments” table provides a list of new, revised, merged and deleted PQs and a brief description of the amendments.

General Guidelines for All Areas

Legislation, Primary Aviation Legislation and Specific Operating Regulations

The term “legislation” in the USOAP CMA Protocol Questions is used as a generic term to include primary aviation legislation  and specific operating
regulations.

The  term  “primary aviation legislation” in the USOAP CMA Protocol Questions includes  any  legislative  provision  and/or  instrument  promulgated and
enforceable  in  the  State (e.g. laws, acts, codes and international treaties).

The  term  “specific operating regulations” in the USOAP CMA Protocol Questions includes any binding regulatory provisions and/or instruments in the
State (e.g. regulations, decrees, rules, and orders).

Processes and Procedures

Processes and procedures should clarify who does what, how, when (or within what timeframes) and in coordination with whom, as applicable.

Delegation of Duties and Tasks

When  a  State  has  delegated  some  of  its  safety  oversight  duties  and  tasks  to  another  State  or  organization,  the  PQs  on  the  delegation  may  have  to be
evaluated with the entity to which the duties and tasks have been delegated.

The  State  remains  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  delegated  duties  and  tasks  are  performed,  at  all  times,  by  qualified  individuals  who  ensure  the
implementation of the applicable legislation as well as the established processes and procedures. There should also be a system in place for conducting
surveillance of the delegated duties and tasks and a process for the resolution of identified safety deficiencies.

Regulatory Function versus Service Provider Function

For a State which has not established a clear separation between its regulatory function and its service provider function or where the State Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) is both the regulator AND the service provider, the related PQs remain applicable.

QMSF-007-07/L (September 2024) – Revision 1

USOAP CMA 2024 Protocol Questions — ANS

Page 5 of 58

Industry Visits

Industry  visits  are  conducted  to  review  and  verify  that  the  implementation  of  the  established  requirements,  procedures  and  safe  practices  in  each
area  complies with ICAO provisions and the State’s applicable national legislation.

On-Site Activity

PQs that can only be assessed in a USOAP CMA on-site activity are shown in shaded rows in the PQ table.

Priority Protocol Questions (PPQs)

A subset of PQs is classified as Priority PQs or PPQs, which, if found not satisfactory, may indicate a lack of capability by a State to identify and/or
resolve operational safety and fundamental accident investigation deficiencies effectively.

Annex

The term “Annex” in the USOAP CMA Protocol Questions stands for Annex to the Chicago Convention.

ICAO References

The  ICAO  references  are  classified  as  follows  (shown  here  in  alphabetical  order):  Chicago  Convention  (CC),  ICAO  Circular  (Cir),  ICAO  Guidance
Material  (GM),  Procedures  for  Air  Navigation  Services  (PANS),  Recommended  Practice  (RP),  Regional  Supplementary  Procedures  (SUPPS),  and
Standard (STD).

Specific Guidelines for ANS

The ANS PQs are based primarily on the Chicago Convention, Annexes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12 and 15 to the Chicago Convention as well as associated
ICAO guidance material.

The USOAP CMA activities in the area of ANS address legislative and regulatory provisions, including operational and oversight activities, in seven
fields, namely:

1)   Air Traffic Management (ATM),
2)   Procedures for Air Navigation Services: Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS),
3)   Aeronautical Information Services (AIS),
4)   Aeronautical Charts (Chart),
5)   Communications, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS),
6)   Aeronautical Meteorology (MET), and
7)   Search and Rescue (SAR).

The PQs on ANS-related legislative provisions address conformance with the Chicago Convention, including, but not limited to, the following articles:

a)   Article 3 bis,
b)   Article 12 (Rules of the air),
c)   Article 25 (Aircraft in distress),
d)   Article 28 (Air navigation facilities and standard systems).
e)   Article 37 (Adoption of international standards and procedures), and
f)  Article 38 (Departures from international standards and procedures).

The term “inspectorate,” as applied in this document, refers to “an office or entity designated by the regulatory body to support safety oversight activities
over the service providers”. An inspectorate may be composed of inspectors, technical support staff, administrative personnel and others directly engaged
in supporting the office or entity’s oversight activities. For this document, an inspectorate may also be referred to as the  technical staff. Inspectors are
personnel directly engaged in carrying out oversight activities (e.g. inspections, audits, etc.) over the service providers
